# Physics Informed Neural Networks(PINNs)
This repository involves my studies on PINNs, reports and examples written with a PINN modeule in early development.
* Notebooks directory includes the examples I have written with this module. The examples include:
  * A simple linear damped harmonic oscillator
  * Schr√∂dinger's equation
  * Wave equation
  * Burger's equation
  * Two heat equations
 * Reports directory includes the reports I have written during my studies.
